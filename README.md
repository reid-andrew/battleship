## Battleship

### Overview:

This is a paired project by Andrew Reid and Jesse Gietzen. The game is played mostly the same way as the board game. Updates to this file and game files expected until 02/13/2020.

### Features:

The game renders cpu and player boards, tracking hits, misses, sunk ships, and displaying player ships.

Player can choose any combination of valid ship coordinates. Code is in place to also allow random ship placement, though this feature has not been implemented yet.

### Wishlist:

Player input to choose board size. This is currently partially coded and currently disabled.

Player choosing number of ships to deploy.

Player choosing custom ship names and sizes.

### To Play:

This game is programmed with ruby files. Open the Battleship_runner.rb file with any program that handles ruby files to play.
